# MaximumSubarrayProblem

NOTE: This project is aimed towards solving the maximum subarray problem using Dynamic Programming, which is the most efficient way of solving this kind of problem. Time Complexity: O(n)

The maximum subarray problem is the task of finding the contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers which has the largest sum.

### Solution

Class [MaximumSubarrayProblem](MaximumSubarrayProblem/src/com/company/MaximumSubArray.java) shows the classical problem. The input Array may contain positive and negative numbers. 

Class [MaximumSubarrayProblemColor](MaximumSubarrayProblem/src/com/company/MaximumSubArrayColor.java) is a slight variation of this problem. The input Array contains colors. Each color has its own value (positive or negative integer).
