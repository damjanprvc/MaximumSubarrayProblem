# MaximumSubarrayProblem

NOTE: This project is aimed towards solving the maximum subarray problem using Dynamic Programming, which is the most efficient way of solving this kind of problem. Time Complexity: O(n)

The maximum subarray problem is the task of finding the contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers which has the largest sum.
